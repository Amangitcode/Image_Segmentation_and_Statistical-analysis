# Image Segmentation and Statistical analysi to determine cancer cells progression

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as super-pixels). Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. 

The goal of this project is to segment, simplify and/or change the representation of an images into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Two images have been taken from a cancer affected specimen/animal at two different time. Image segmentation and statistical analysis techniques have been applied to determine cancer cells progression in that area of specimen.
